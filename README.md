saliency_co-fusion: generate saliency co-fusion maps for each image.

macro_weight_calculation: calculate macro-weight for each saliency map according to their separation measure and concentration measure.

segmentation: segment saliency map for each image using Ostu and Contour.

evaluation: evaluate object co-segmentation performance using Jaccard Similarity, BF Score, and Dice Similarity.
